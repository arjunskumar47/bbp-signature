== Description ==

This plugin adds user signature support to bbPress 2.0. Currently support have been added for BuddyPress installations as well which have site wide forums enabled.

Currently, users are supported with:

 1. Maximum length of 500 charactors in the user edit page for the signature.
 2. User signature for topics and replies.

We'll be adding a custom length selector for admin in the admin panel in the upcoming releases.
If you'd like to add bbcodes support to the user signature, you might want to install [bbPress2 BBCode](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bbpress-bbcode/) plugin. Output from bbcode plugin is in screenshot 3.
